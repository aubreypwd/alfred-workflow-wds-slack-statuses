# WDS Slack Statuses

An easy way (for me) to set Slack statuses at WebDevStudios.

This workflow requires the sl command line tool https://github.com/rockymadden/slack-cli and for it to be integrated with your Slack workspace.

This is highly customized for me, but you can maybe fork and/or tweak for your own purposes.

# Install

To install head over to [releases](../../releases) and download the `.alfred-worflow` file and open it. Or clone this repository to your `Alfred.alfredpreferences/workflows` directory.
